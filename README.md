# Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing - Course Notes

This repository contains my personal notes, assignments, and projects for the Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing course. I'm using this space to document my learning journey and implement various NLP techniques using machine learning approaches.

## Course Projects

Throughout this course, I'll be working on several projects that apply NLP techniques to real-world problems:

### Project 1: Hotel Recommendation System Using NLP

This project focuses on developing an advanced recommendation system for hotels using natural language processing techniques. The goal is to identify semantically similar hotels based on user reviews from the TripAdvisor Hotel Review dataset.

#### Project Components

1. **Data Processing and Analysis**
   - Working with TripAdvisor Hotel Review dataset
   - Processing reviews with ratings across seven aspects (service, cleanliness, overall experience, etc.)
   - Implementing data filtering and aggregation techniques
   - Computing average ratings for comprehensive hotel evaluation

2. **Model Implementation and Comparison**
   - Implementing BM25 as a baseline (with and without preprocessing)
   - Developing a hybrid model combining BM25 with semantic embeddings
   - Exploring transformer-based architectures (MPNet)
   - Implementing specialized models (SimSec, MXBI Colbert)
   - Comparing model performance using MSE and processing time metrics

3. **Technical Approaches**
   - Text preprocessing and cleaning
   - Semantic embeddings generation
   - GPU-accelerated computations
   - Token-level contextualization
   - Similarity scoring and ranking

4. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Measuring Mean Squared Error (MSE) for accuracy
   - Analyzing query processing times
   - Comparing model efficiency and resource usage
   - Evaluating trade-offs between speed and accuracy

The project provides hands-on experience with both traditional information retrieval methods and modern deep learning approaches in NLP, emphasizing practical implementation and performance optimization.
